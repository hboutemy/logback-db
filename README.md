# logback-db

As of version 1.2.8, logback no longer ships with `DBAppender`.

This project remedies this by providing `DBAppender` for logback-classic and logback-access.
The logback-classic-db module contains `DBAppender` for logback-classic. The logback-acess-db module contains `DBAppender` for logback-access.

Both logback-classic-db and logback-acess-db modules require logback-code-db module.

Here are the Maven coordiates for the aforementioned  components:

  `ch.qos.logback.db:logback-core-db:1.2.11`
  `ch.qos.logback.db:logback-classic-db:1.2.11`
  `ch.qos.logback.db:logback-access-db:1.2.11`
